## Stretch goal : Using Docker to mount your project onto an image 


Pipelines can take a long time to complete. There are several shortcuts that may help you obtain faster builds.  However, the fastest way to simulate what the pipelines are doing is to run them locally from your own machine.  Docker can help make this possible. 

The stretch goal for this project is to use disk mounting with Docker to optimize the testing process before pushing your project to GitLab.
