## Stretch goal : Using Docker to mount your project onto an image 


Pipelines can take a long time to complete. There are several shortcuts that may help you obtain faster builds.  However, the fastest way to simulate what the pipelines are doing is to run them locally from your own machine.  Docker can help make this possible. 

The video below demonstrates how you can use disk mounting with Docker to optimize the testing process before pushing your project to GitLab.

Watch the video below. Then obtain a Docker image that has tests in it, mount the image localy on your machine, and run the tests locally as shown below. When you are comfortable with this process, record the procedure, upload it to the cloud ( YouTube, GoogleDrive, etc.) and paste the link of the uploaded video below.
