## IMPORTANT ! 
You may run into CORS errors when accessing an external API while running a local Angular project. Ask your instructor to provide a quick lecture on CORS.  There are many ways around this, but one easy way is to use a CORS proxy like CORS ANYWHERE. Please be mindful that this is a public resource that was made for students and should not be abused or used on high-volume, commercially facing sites. 

Here's how you use CORS ANYWHERE: prefix the url that your http service is hitting with https://cors-anywhere.com . 

Example: You want to use 
```
https://animechan.vercel.app/api/random
```
but you're getting a CORS error. 

Change your URL to 

```
https://cors-anywhere.com/https://animechan.vercel.app/api/random
```

And it should work. You can also use the [CORS plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en).
