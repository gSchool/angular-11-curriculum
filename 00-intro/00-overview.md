## Overview : Angular curriculum


The purpose of this curriculum is to quickly up to speed using Angular. 

You are most likely aware of the fact that Angular is a front end javascript framework.  A ‘framework’ is a set of connected libraries designed around a specific programming language. Frameworks provide conventions that support doing things a certain way.  A front end framework typically has specific conventions around how HTML is handled, how forms are created, how interactive elements on a web page are handled, how variables are interpolated inside of HTML views, etc. 

Many of you with backgrounds in React will note that the learning curve for getting started in Angular is a bit steeper than it is in React. There are many reasons for this.  

First of all, Angular uses TypeScript of the box, which is transpiled into Javascript before run time. TypeScript is certainly available to use with React, but it's very possible to build a React application without TypeScript. Most React applications just use Javascript, making development very easy in the initial stages of work.  While TypeScript is very similar to Javascript, there are certain aspects to the language that may take a bit of time to get used to.  

The other reason Angular has a steeper learning curve than other frameworks like React is that Angular is a true example of a 'classic' framework. We mentioned above that frameworks prescribe a certain way of doing things, so there is a set of conventions that you need to follow to get into the workflow that the community uses. React, while full of many conventions, is much more freeform, it uses pure Javascript, and as a developer, you can develop your own patterns and conventions farily quickly when building an application. In Angular, those 'ways of doing things' are embedded into the framework.  Angular has a built-in router, it has a built-in way of making http calls, it has built in features like services, and it features TypeScript features like interfaces to provide structures for the user.   

Angular's steep initial learning curve is compensated by the fact that once you get used to the framework, development in the intermediate and advanced stages gets much easier. This is one of the reasons why many enterprises and medium to large businesses use Angular. The framework provides a structure that scales very nicely and it's easy for large teams to form dev work around the structures that Angular provides. 

Angular JS or “Angular 1.x” was the first iteration of the Angular framework.  With the release of Angular 2, Angular was completely redesigned using TypeScript and component based architecture. Although component based architecture was available in the later releases of Angular 1.x, components are now the very foundation of Angular 2 and all subsequent releases after version 2.  After 2, Angular 4 was released and versions counted upwards from there ( there was no version 3). 

Angular 11 was released in November of 2020 and that is the focus of this course. It is important to understand that the Angular team has comitted itself to doing frequent releases of Angular.  To this end, the Angular team is bound to release a newer version of Angular while you are working on any given project, and chances are that by the time you are reading this, Angular 11 will no longer be the latest stable release. 

Keep in mind that the most of the core Angular concepts in this course are most likely going to stay relevant for a while in Angular.
