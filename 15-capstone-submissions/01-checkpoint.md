 Your capstone services

### Submit all of your deployed urls with a label, a colon, and the url, separated by commas. 

#### Example: 

front end: http://whatever.t-mobile.com/ , user service: http://whatever.t-mobile.com/ , 
locations service: http://whatever.t-mobile.com/ , another service: http://whatever.t-mobile.com/ 


It may be easiest to copy all of that in a text file and paste it right into the submission form.
