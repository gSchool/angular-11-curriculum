## Conducktor

In this lesson, we will take an application and deploy it to Conducktor. You will, ideally, be able to deploy a back end Spring Boot Microservice _and_ a front end Angular application that will talk to each other within our provisioned Conducktor namespace at T-Mobile. 

Deploying to Conducktor takes a lot of steps.  Be patient with yourself, allow for error, and keep working through all of these exercises until you get the deployment right. In the end, you will gain a better understanding of how things are set up in Conducktor and you will be one step closer to understanding how Microservice deployments work within T-Mobile's Conducktor ecosystem.
