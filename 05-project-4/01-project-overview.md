## Project Overview

### What will we be building ? 

Your Assignment this sprint is to build a project that has

* A front end 
* A back end that consists of 3 or more microservices 
* At least one database (for now) that handles all data transactions
* Deploy all of it to Conducktor 
* Although your capstones will follow a mobile user / mobile phone theme, project 4 can be anything and any subject that you want it to be. 

### How will we be building it ? What is due and when ? 

* By the end of the sprint, fill out all of the assignment fields within this sprint section.

* Unlike the sprints in the first week, all of the links you will be submitting in this section will be team links. 

* Certain sections may require you to elaborate on your individual contribution to a group effort. 

* There is a lot to done in this sprint. We suggest the following order to be in harmony with T-Mobile's software development process of feature request, design, build, test, deploy, and observe: 

```
Brainstorm your idea together as a team
Design wireframes to flesh out ideas
Create user stories
Build your front end and microservices
Test ( if not automated, use smoke testing)
Deploy to Conducktor
Observe and refine 
```


* Please note:  we were able to get an RDS instance approved for database development, but we still have yet to test it and make sure it's configured for use. This should be ready by mid day Tuesday, October 27th. If you are using Spring Boot, you may want to consider using an H2 database, which should not require the use of an external database, to start, and then possibly switch over to a more standard database after Tuesday. Or you could wait, considering how much other work needs to get done before that point.
