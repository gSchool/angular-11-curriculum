## User Stories

Using Trello, Jira, Pivotal Tracker, or any other KanBan board that you can get your hands on, create Gherkin stories to flesh out the requirements for all of your app's features. Be realistic; you only have a few days, so don't bite off more than you can chew. Simple is good. 
If you need to review the slides on Gherkin user stories, they are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17njRBmYT18QXWKPbk0ggjgk41CB2VtGa0CM8Yx5BqGE/edit?usp=sharing)

*Question*:  "We use Jira at T-Mobile, so why are we being given the option to choose another project management software for this project ? " 

*Answer*:  Project management software is farily easy to use, so we are giving you the freedom to choose your own because the most important thing about kanban boards is not the softare itself, but the *concepts* of writing user stories , using them as a way to manage features, and understanding acceptance criteria. This should happen regardless of the software that you are using.
