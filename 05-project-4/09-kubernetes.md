## Optional Kubernetes exposure

T-Mobile does not require you to know anything about Kubernetes to deploy your app to Conducktor. One apsect of Conducktor is that it contains a wrapper for Kubernetes, so it handles all of the things that you need Kubernetes for inside of its interface. 

We have decided in this cohort, however, to expose you to the concepts behind Kubernetes.  To that end, we will offer a few overview workshops and lectures to expose you to the subject so that you can get a cluster up and running on your local machine with the Microservices you built for this project living inside of local Kubernetes deployments. 


### Core subjects and competencies : 
T-Mobile's Conducktor platform 
Microservices fundamentals
Kuberenets fundamentals
Setting up a Kubernetes cluster locally and populating it with Microservices
