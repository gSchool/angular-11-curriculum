## Iteration

In the process of demonstrating how to make a successful API call in Angular, we will take the following steps: 

1. Iterate through a local array
2. Iterate through an array of objects
3. Iterate through an array of objects given to us from a service
4. Make the service make an http


Essentially we will be showing how to retrieve data from a very local place ( the controller ) , and then keep moving the data back all the way until it's coming from a service, which is the place where we usually make api calls by convention in Angular.
