## Iteration

In the process of demonstrating how to make a successful API call in Angular, we will take the following steps: 

1. Iterate through a local array
2. Iterate through an array of objects
3. Iterate through an array of objects given to us from a service
4. Make the service make an http

We will now be working with the "planes" app that we started in the beginning of this course. 

Essentially we will be showing how to retrieve flight information from a very local place ( the controller ) , and then keep moving the data back all the way until it's coming from a service, which is the place where we usually make api calls by convention in Angular. This is the simple infrastructure that's neccesary to set up an environment to make api calls in Angular.
