### How to use this curriculum 

This course was built specificallly for T-Mobile and is broken down into a series of projects. 
This course will use the following formats and methods to deliver content and learning experiences: 

* Project based learning
    - Project based learning uses hands on experiences with an emphasis on trainees 'getting their hands dirty' as soon as possible and learning most of their key lessons from actual experiences rather than sitting through long lectures. 

* Scaffolding and differentiation
    - Lessons are broken down into relatively small units, often with relatively short segments. Each small segment is built on top of a previous segement and/or previous student knowledge. This process is referred to as *scaffolding*.  The purpose of breaking things down into smaller units is similar to the idea of developing Microservices in software architecture as opposted to monoliths. In the context of education, 'smaller' units are easy to isolate, consume, and digest. Additionally, smaller segments allow some students to repeat certain sections several times over until they understand a topic while allowing other students to skip content that is already familiar to them. You will find that most videos in this curriculum are between 2 and 10 minutes long. *Differentiation* simply refers to the fact that this curriculum , while reinforcing core concepts for all users, often takes the time to illustrate different examples of a topic for both back end and front end developers respectively. 

* Flipped classroom
    - The *flipped classroom* model makes the majority of lectures available in video format before class starts. At the beginning of class, the instructor or instructors will typically deliver another relatively short lecture framing the subject, going over the project that will ensue, taking student questions, and discussing the general subject.  After the framing lecture, students will typically break into smaller teams and begin work on the projects.  Some students will watch and re-watch the video based lectures, while other students may quickly work through the project or examples with little assistance, skipping over redundant content or content not related to their line of work.  Instructors circulate through the groups and provide 1:1 or small group assistance.  This model maximizes that amount of in-person assistance that instructors can give students while also letting students work at their own pace to a large extent. This model has proven to be highly effective with technical trainees who vary widely in terms of skill level and experience. If it turns out that all students are in the exact same place or getting stuck in the exact same areas, it is always possible to reconvene as an entire class and go over any given subject as a whole group.  The flexibility of this model tends to yield very high satisfaction levels with trainees. 


Pacing is set by the instructor based on how long instructors anticipate students will need to complete each project. Currently, each project is set to take an average of 1 to 1.5 days, with some flexibility for certain projects that may take slightly longer. 

At the end of the course, there will be one final project that incorporates many of the lessons and skill sets acquired throughout the course.
