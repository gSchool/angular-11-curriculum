## T-Mobile Jazz Deployments

### What is Jazz ? 

Jazz is a new T-Mobile technology that allows you to quickly deploy applications with a few clicks. 
Deployments in Jazz are significantly easier than PCF and Conducktor deployments. 

The documentation for Jazz is so straight forward and simple, we found it best to simply direct you to the existing written documentation.  Addtionally, we have provided a short video to demonstrate how to initiate a Jazz deployment:

What's due: 

There are two things that are due for you in the checkpoint. 

1. A deployed URL of a personal application that you deployed in Jazz
2. A link to the GitHub repo from your Jazz deployment
3. A link to either a front end or back end microservice incorporated into your sprint 4 project that communicates with your Conducktor deployed resources.
